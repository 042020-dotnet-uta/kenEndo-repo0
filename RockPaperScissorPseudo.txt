<--global field-->
-Round number 
-roundArrayList

<--Player class-->
-player have name, player have score
-player gets rpsGenerator { creating random number bwteen 0-2
and then changing the number to ["rock", "paper", "scissor"]} 

<-- main function-->
-prompt user for first player, second player 
-run loop using while until one of the player reaches the score of 2
-call the rpsGenerator method for the two players
-compare the two players last round by using if statement. if statement ----will have player1's result(r/p/s) with nested if statement comparing it to -player2's result(r/p/s).


Example:
if (player1.rpsGenerator() == "rock")
                {
                    if (player2.rpsGenerator() == "paper")
                    {
                        $"Round {roundNumber} - {player2.name} chose rock, {player1.name} chose rock. - Player2 won";
                        "It is a tie ";}
     
                        
-within the same if statement which ever player wins add 1 (playerScore++) to the player score. 
-within the same if statement which ever player wins/lose/tie add the string into the the roundArrayList with the updated Round number.

-once a player reaches 2 on their player score we get out of the loop.
-loop through the roundArrayList, that stored all the round information, to display on the console.
-if statement to see which player has the score of 2 and display the winner and final score on console.
